**ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**  
*Bridging Traditional Economic Theory with Modern Data Science*

---

## 👋 About Me

I'm an undergraduate student double-majoring in **Computer Science** and **Economics**, passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world economic problems. I'm actively seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis**, **Economic Consulting**, and **Finance**, where I can apply both technical programming skills and rigorous economic thinking.

My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional economic theory and modern data science—combining the causal rigor of econometrics with the predictive power of machine learning and scalable software engineering.

## 📚 About This Portfolio

This repository showcases my coursework, labs, and projects from **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. The course takes a unique **"Concept Extension"** approach to learning:

- **Start with Foundations**: Begin with core statistical concepts (e.g., linear regression, hypothesis testing)
- **Scale with Machine Learning**: Extend these concepts using modern ML algorithms (e.g., Lasso, Ridge, Random Forests)
- **Bridge Two Worlds**: Learn to navigate between causal inference (answering "why?") and predictive analytics (answering "what will happen?")

Through this portfolio, you'll see my progression in:
- Implementing classical econometric models and understanding their assumptions
- Applying regularization techniques to handle high-dimensional data
- Building predictive models while maintaining economic interpretability
- Translating economic questions into data science workflows
